# CSV Search Engine 👨‍💻🔍

## Introduction
Welcome to the CSV Search Engine, a mini project designed to simplify data exploration and searching within CSV files. This lightweight web application enables users to effortlessly sift through data, making it an ideal solution for anyone dealing with CSV datasets. 🚀🔍

## Use
This search engine proves handy in various scenarios, such as:
- Exploring large datasets with ease.
- Searching for specific information within a CSV file.
- Quick data retrieval without the need for complex database systems. 💼💾

## Features
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Automatically populates dropdown menus with column names from the CSV file, ensuring a seamless user experience. 🔄
- **Flexible Search**: Allows users to search for information across specific fields or the entire document, providing flexibility in data retrieval. 🔍📝
- **Real-time Results**: Displays search results in real-time as you type, minimizing wait times and enhancing efficiency. ⏳📊

## How to Use
1. **Download the Code**: Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
2. **Replace CSV File**: Replace the sample CSV file `FILE_NAME.csv` with your own CSV file containing the desired data. Ensure that the CSV file has headers in the first row.
3. **Run the Application**: Use a local development server like `live-server` to run the application locally. If `live-server` is not installed, you can install it globally using `npm install -g live-server`.
4. **Explore and Search**: Open the CSV Search Engine in your web browser and start exploring your data by typing in the search box and selecting search criteria from the dropdown menus. 🕵️‍♂️🔍
